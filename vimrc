" ------- TL;DR ------- go to 'Basic Customization'
"
" Long time ago, I've starting using vim with the basic:
"
" i -> type, type, type <ESC>:wq
"
" Since the smartest people I know in my life uses vim, 
" I decided to give it a shot.
"
" This is still a work in progress and the install script shipped here
" installs some plugins I loved to use
"
" This is also a vim training, so I can practice &:)

" ------- PLUGINS ---------

" Put your plugin calls as soon as possilbe
" Some themes use plugin managers and you will 
" end up with a 'not found' message.

" vim-plug - enables easy plugin installation with git versioning

call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" Searches github "

" Old theme. Too dark, low contrast...
" Plug 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized' 

" My actual theme... Still looking for the perfect one" 
Plug 'zacanger/angr'

" Adds a beautiful status bar in the bottom
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'

" Allows icons inside vim and other plugins
" You MUST install a patched font.
Plug 'ryanoasis/vim-devicons'

" Nice file manager for vim
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree' 

"git stuff"

" Git status indicators for files in NERDtree
Plug 'Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin'

" Git plugin that shows which lines have been added, modified, or removed.
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'

" A Git wrapper that adds a lot of new commands and "gitties" to vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'

call plug#end()


" ------- Basic Customization -------
"
" Here I try to group some tweaks by context. A work in progress.
" I give small hints of what is what to help rememberance.
" 
" I know that there is vimsensible out there, but this is also
" a case study that may be helpful to someone.
