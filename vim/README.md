# Vim Package

Long time ago, I've starting using vim with the basic:

> i -> type, type, type <ESC>:wq

Since the smartest people I know in my life uses vim, I decided to give it a shot.

This is still a work in progress and the install script shipped here installs some plugins I enjoy using

This is also a vim training, so I can practice &:)
