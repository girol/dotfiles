# Setup your environment 

Since I maintain 3 machines to work, I automated my installation to reflect the same environment in all of them.

The idea is to create highly customizable installable "modules".

It used to host only my `.vimrc`, but maintain other packages, other languages and remember what to install was a pain. 


**Linux Distribution:** Ubuntu flavors (Depends on the weather)

**Current Distributin:** Linux Mint 19

## Environment Variables

The `env` file stores them. Customize yours here.

## Colors

I love colorized terminals. I store basic colors in: `colors` file.
