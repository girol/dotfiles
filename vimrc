" ------- TL;DR ------- go to 'Basic Customization'
"
" Long time ago, I've starting using vim with the basic:
"
" i -> type, type, type <ESC>:wq
"
" Since the smartest people I know in my life uses vim, 
" I decided to give it a shot.
"
" This is still a work in progress and the install script shipped here
" installs some plugins I loved to use
"
" This is also a vim training, so I can practice &:)

" ------- Basic Customization -------
"
" Here I try to group some tweaks by context. A work in progress
" I give small hints of what is what to help rememberance
" 
" I know that there is vimsensible out there, but this is also
" a case study that may be helpful to someone
