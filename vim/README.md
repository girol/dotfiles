# Vim Package

This customization uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as dependency manager.

## Quickstart

To install, download `plug.vim` and put it in the "autoload" directory.

Script:

```shell
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Run the command:

:PlugInstall

# Motivation

Long time ago, I've starting using vim with the basic:

> i -> type, type, type <ESC>:wq

Since the smartest people I know in my life uses vim, I decided to give it a shot.

This is still a work in progress and the install script shipped here installs some plugins I enjoy using

This is also a vim training, so I can practice &:)
